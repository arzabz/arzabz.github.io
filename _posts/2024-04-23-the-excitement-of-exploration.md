it's so, too easy to overlook the vast expand world that we live in now, it's just incomprehendable to perceive it all even though it's right in front of us.

the world isn't fully explored yet, space, seas, what's left of the past, what's thought to be nonexistence, they're all wonders to be looked for. yes, some may already have been labeled by another person way back in time, but that doesn't mean that's all there is to that one thing, how does it reproduce? how many rings does it have? how much longer will they do all that?

my fascination and obsessiom of the sea is rooted in the unknown, mysterious landscapes, the inhabitants that slowly rifts between it, the curiosity of imagining what it woild 'feel' to be there, it comforts me.

same goes for space, imagining the nullness of interplanetary voids, the loneliness of venus and pluto, the soft mysterious clouds of gas in jupiter, the sense of isolation, although uncanny, it gets my gears going.
