ever since i took part in an astronomy olympiad, i've taken and larger interest to the field and have been consuming a good amount of space media, especially the videos made by astrum on youtube, their work is great.\
\
one of the things that has been sitting in my mind is how close we've gotten to every planet in the solar system, along with its satellite(s), and even some objects beyond that point.\
\
cassini is one of my favorite probe out of all the others, for the amount of visuals that it has sent to earth, and for its dramatic crash towards saturn's atmosphere. it has went through such great lengths to become saturn' lone inhabitor in the end.\
\
about saturn, a gas giant encircled by its layers of rings, it's just great to look at. seen up close, you can see the satellites (or moons, a simpler way to say it) occasionally appear between the rings, obstructing the small rocks to make a path for itself, it honestly resembles a runner on a track. that really was the first thing that came to thought when i saw this image, a runner just passing by on its casual 0.6 day-long loop around the planet.

the way the light of the sun shines and reflects off saturn's surface (if you could call it that) just showcases its behemoth size and roundness, a cosmically perfectly round object akind to other planets.\

the desolate space is such a wonder for us.
