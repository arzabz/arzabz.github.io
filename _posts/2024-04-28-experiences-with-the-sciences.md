science is an amazing thing to exist, it's probably the most natural way for an average man to understand the world. one of my first deliberate exploration into science was way back in 2020, when i learnt about dinosaurs through pbs eons, and then to fishes after learning about the dunkleosteus (the coolest kind of fish to ever exist).\
\
since then i've taken more interest into many more fields, i'll talk about them in the order that i studied them for a while, just want to blurb out what part of those sciences that i really am interest in for future references.
\
1. biology.
\
continuing off from the first paragraph, what really got me into the sciences were studying about fishes! from what i know there are bony fishes (osteoichtyes) which is then subdivided into lobe-finned fish (sarcopterygee, my favorites for just how rare they are now) and ray-finned fish (actinoperygee), and there are also cartilage-boned fishes (chondrichyes) or sharks!\

\
if you somehow met me back then, it probably was through biocord where i would ramble on for hours about marine animals and questions about the origins of life, those times are dear to me.\
\
nowadays, i still have interests in discoveries surround marine life even if i don't study it formally now. its something that i really can't avoid diving deep into because it's that important to me, i'll probably write something about it next time.\
\
2. physics
\
instead of going over the entire field, i just want to talk about the topics that i'm interested in: alternative energy, and engineering, still thinking of a third one.\
\
alternative energy really has the potential to thrive, i'm not just walking about windmills and solar panels, but nuclear reactors as well. there is barely any reason for us to continue using non-sustainable, harmful, and polluting energy resources when the technology is there to develop, it's just a very interesting and creative way to extract energy! and that's energy that would benefit an incredibly large amount of people.\

\
engineering, that's pretty general but i have a particular attachment for creating stuff. what hooks me in is the art and craftmanship involved in it, the capacity that you dedicate yourself to put in effort into some tangible thing that might benefit yourself or others by means of that process. i see the field as a medium where you can express your inner workings without being too abstract, and that's awesome.\
\
if i ever get involved in an engineering field in the future, it'll probably be in environmental engineering, electrical engineering, or anything related to machinery.\
\
3. chemistry
\
i never actually had enough time to study this field alone, the few times that i do take interest in it is when it's involved in biological mechanisms or molecular physics discussions, a shame really.\
\
4. geography
\
what i enjoy about this field is discussion about the environment, natural habitats, and tectonic plates! the most intuitive way to learn about the earth and how volatile it is, and mountains are great too.\
\
5. astronomy
\
very cool field! i love exploration, and there's nothing tangible that's more expansive than space. for now, i'm just interested in the objects found in the solar system and their corresponding probes, can't wait for nasa to explore the oceans of europa and enceladus in the future.
