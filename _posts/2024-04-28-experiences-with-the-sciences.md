science is an amazing thing to exist, it's probably the most natural way for an average man to understand the world. one of my first deliberate exploration into science was way back in 2020, when i learnt about dinosaurs through pbs eons, and then to fishes after learning about the dunkleosteus (the coolest fish to ever exist).\
\
since then i've taken more interest into many more fields, i'll talk about them in the order that i studied them for a while, just want to blurb out what part of those sciences that i really am interest in for future references.\
\
1. biology.\
\
continuing off from the first paragraph, what really got me into the sciences were studying about fishes! from what i know there are bony fishes (osteoichtyes) which is then subdivided into lobe-finned fish (sarcopterygee, my favorites for just how rare they are now) and ray-finned fish (actinoperygee), and there are also cartilage-boned fishes (chondrichyes) or sharks!\
\
if you somehow met me back then, it probably was through biocord where i would ramble on for hours about marine animals and questions about the origins of life, those times are dear to me.\
\
nowadays, i still have interests in discoveries surround marine life even if i don't study it formally now. its something that i really can't avoid diving deep into because it's that important to me, i'll probably write something about it next time.\
\
2. physics.\
