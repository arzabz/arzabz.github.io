it's easy to say that almost everything can be considered as art, and honestly i don't mind it being that way. art (at least to me) is any medium that you can use to express yourself, where it'd be something as systematical as document work, or as abstract as a way of thinking. one of the arts that i think should be more important is learning --- the acquisition of knowledge.\
\
i always find it interesting when a person actively pursues their education, or being passionate in what they're currently learning on their own. it gets you thinking, what kind of goal are they trying to achieve? will they be consistently doing that, or will they gradually stop when that happens? being passionate is attractive, it's just something most can relate to.\
\
passion can also be found in work (not necessarily traditional office work), how serious you are about it, how you want others to view it, how you tailor tiny details to your liking --- but uniqueness is a struggle, you must pertain the standard but achieve that in a way unlike many, there is no mindless work present, you are actively in a tug of war with what you ideally want and what you can do, even if it doesn't seem like it -- even if it's something that few will be aware of, you are at peace with how you stay in tune with yourself, and i feel like that's how i've always embraced myself.

i'll keep on improving my arts, and i've decided that since day one; not particularly in random small sketches, but in the way i express myself. if there is more to me, there's nothing better that i can do other than to realize it.
