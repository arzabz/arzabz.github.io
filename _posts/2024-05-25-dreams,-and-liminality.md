if anyone were to ask me about my dreams and its reoccuring themes, i would have a lot to cover, but i'll admit that it's a pretty odd thing to ask.\
\
to dream is like to live your life not knowing that none of it is true. it feels normally long like any other day but so rapid when you look back at it, filled with fallacies but beautifully arranged unlike many other days.\
\
during the covid lockdown, i had a horrid sleeping pattern where i would wake up in the morning just to fall asleep again repeatedly, this was seriously unhealthy --- but it was also the time where i would had more vivid dreams, contained within those 20-40 minutes of 2-3 consecutive naps.

  my evergoing routine of waking up and going to bed again repeatedly in the morning, i've always thought of capturing this moment but never got the time until now.

it's hard to find the general theme of those dreams, some of it is comforting, fun, absolutely horrifying, or straight up apocalyptic; but it was always the fantastical aspect of those dreams that made it memorable, and there was always the confusion of waking up --- the decisive moment where you either remember that dream or not.\
\
dream always feel 'new' but familiar enough, it tends to feel liminal. there are many differing thoughts on liminality, but for me its that feeling of familiarity and loneliness --- present in a surreal view of places meant for an audience that does not exist or is not currently present.

    one picture that is just beautiful to look at since the first time i saw it, the vibrant look of it put out of context with there being no people in the view makes it 'liminal'. (image from u/illythekitty)

liminal space is not meant to be scary (for me, at least), it's the sense of knowing something in a place you've never went to, and it's reassuring as it mimics your past experiences of many locations before --- the background of your memories that you've never really noticed.\
\
i'm just amazed at how many people are able to relate to this specific aesthetic alone and the amount of large communities that are centered around it. we lure ourselves to the unknown in the search of a feeling.
