hello, to myself, and to you, who just happened to stumble upon this small corner of the web. this is primarily a site i dedicate for writing my own ideas, stories, and alike (a convoluted way to say blog-posting). i also just think it would be interesting to have your own personalized place online, away from the clutter and lousiness of the internet.\
\
there's not much going on here, at least not yet, but i hope you can enjoy your short (or prolonged) stay here.

places: megastructures, wide spaces, comfy interiors, and anything related to nature - mountains, forests, and clouds \
\
time of day: morning (preferably 5-7 am), cloudy, blue-purple or pink sky (prefer sunshine more in the morning) \
